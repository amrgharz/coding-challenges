    <h1>Challenge 5</h1>
    <p>
        Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
        gymnastics discipline, which works differently.<br>
        Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
        one average score per team).<br>
        A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
        Otherwise, no team wins!<br>
        Your tasks:<br>
        1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores<br>
        2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams<br>
        3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team<br>
        as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner<br>
        to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.<br>
        Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"<br>
        4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
        Data 2<br>
        5. Ignore draws this time<br>
        Test data:<br>
        ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49<br>
        ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27<br>
